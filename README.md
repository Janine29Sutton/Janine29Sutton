## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m an AI developer focused on building intelligent tools and applications using LangChain and large language model (LLM) APIs. This repository is a collection of my experiments, prototypes, and practical implementations aimed at leveraging the power of language models for real-world problem-solving.

LangChain has been a key part of my development workflow, allowing me to structure complex interactions between users, models, and external data sources. Iâ€™m exploring how to build modular pipelines for tasks like question answering, summarization, code generation, and conversational interfaces. By combining LLMs with tools like vector databases, APIs, and file parsers, Iâ€™m working to make these systems context-aware, responsive, and genuinely useful.

This repo includes projects where I integrate models from platforms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and othersâ€”using both hosted APIs and local model options when possible. I'm learning how to chain prompts effectively, manage memory, and use agents to create more dynamic workflows. My goal is to move beyond basic prompt-response patterns and into more robust, multi-step applications that can adapt and scale.

You'll find sample tools like chatbots with persistent memory, document-based question answering systems, and task-specific assistants. I also include environment setup instructions, key design notes, and areas where Iâ€™m still experimenting or seeking feedback.

Security, performance, and responsible AI use are also top priorities as I build. I'm always exploring how to fine-tune model behavior, reduce hallucinations, and ensure safe, predictable responses.

If you're also working with LangChain or exploring the LLM ecosystem, feel free to check out the code, share suggestions, or collaborate.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building smarter, language-powered tools, one chain at a time.
